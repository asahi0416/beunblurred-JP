## Security Best Practices for Contributors

1. **Code Reviews**: All pull requests should undergo thorough review to catch potential security issues.
2. **Sensitive Data**: Avoid committing sensitive information such as passwords, API keys, or credentials.
3. **Dependencies**: Ensure all external libraries or dependencies are up-to-date to minimize security risks.
4. **Secrets Management**: Use appropriate secrets management solutions, such as environment variables or GitHub Secrets, rather than hard-coding sensitive data.
5. **Regular Scans**: Utilize tools like [GitHub's Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/keeping-your-dependencies-updated-automatically) to scan for vulnerabilities in dependencies.
